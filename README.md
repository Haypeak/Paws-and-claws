# Paws-and-claws
All developments for the paws and claws project

In the repository there are two folders `dev` and `main`.

### dev

This is for all development work that needs to be tested before being deployed.
After the feature is developed, the Testers will write tests for the feature and place the tests in the **tests folder**. Until the feature is tested, The feature will not be added to the main folder.
All features will need to have comments that state how each feature is implemented, the resources needed for implementation and the type of the data it inputs and outputs.

The dev folder will be used as a open space to try all the different features before the feature is deployed

### Main

This is the main project folder. This folder will contain code and documentation for the project.
Without proper tests and validation no code will be placed in this folder.
This is to prevent breaks in the website when it is deployed so for every implementation made, it will have to be tested and validated by the testers and devops engineers before the feature is deployed. This does not mean that there would have to be a long meeting to validate the feature, just after the testers and Devops engineers have tested the feature and made sure there are no problems the feature can be added to the main folder. 

:warning: Each file in the main folder would have to be well documented to allow the other developers working with you to easily understand what you have done. This will also prevent unnecessary crashing due to lack of proper dependencies.
